### Why am I on GitHub

- I find useful to store my code in repositories, to share my projects between my devices.
- I really like the idea to secure my code in case one of my devices breaks up.
- I want to show what I did in my University period.
- Automated builds with Docker Hub and GitHub are awesome.
- Versioning Control is awesome, and I like the idea to know how it works. My future will be with a team, which uses Versioning Control (I hope...).
- Work in progress...
