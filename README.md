### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:book: Profession: Student

:round_pushpin: Where: Roma Tre University

:mortar_board: First level degree: 2018

:mortar_board: Second level degree: 80% loading... 

### Why am I on GitHub

- I find useful to store my code in repositories, to share my projects between my devices.
- I really like the idea to secure my code in case one of my devices breaks up.
- I want to show what I did in my University period.
- Automated builds with Docker Hub and GitHub are awesome.
- Versioning Control is awesome, and I like the idea of knowing how it works. My future will be with a team, which uses Versioning Control (I hope...).
