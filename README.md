### Why am I on GitHub

- I find useful to store my code in repositories, to share my projects between my devices.
- I really like the idea to secure my code in case one of my devices breaks up.
- I want to show what I did in my University period.
- Automated builds with Docker Hub and GitHub are awesome.
- Versioning Control is awesome, and I like the idea of knowing how it works. My future will be with a team, which uses Versioning Control (I hope...).

### VQModel

I'm building a web application for an aircraft RC models factory in Vietnam. This factory is called VQModel, and it is managed by a piece of my family.

First release has not been launched yet yet, but here you can see the latest [VQModel demo](http://vqmodel.com/angular).
